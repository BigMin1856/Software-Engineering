## How to connect GitHub and Git
- Clone repository to local machine
- Use this command:
        git remote add origin [remote repo URL MAKE SURE THE URL IS FOR SSH]
- Follow this article (https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) on how to generate new key
- Edit this file wiht your PUBLIC key (should be id_rsa.pub) so I can add it so you can get access to github via command line
